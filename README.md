# TypeScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my TypeScript learning journey! This file serves as a roadmap, notes repository, and tracker for everything I learn about TypeScript.

---

## **Why TypeScript?**
TypeScript enhances JavaScript by adding static typing, making it easier to:
- Catch errors during development.
- Build scalable and maintainable applications.
- Leverage modern features while supporting older JavaScript runtimes.

---

## **Learning Objectives**
1. Understand the basics of TypeScript, including syntax and configuration.
2. Explore TypeScript features like interfaces, generics, and type inference.
3. Develop a strong foundation to build type-safe and robust applications.

---

## **Topics Covered**

### 1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**
- Installing TypeScript.
- Setting up a basic `tsconfig.json` file.
- Compiling TypeScript into JavaScript using the TypeScript Compiler (`tsc`).

### 2. **Basic Types**
- `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, and `undefined`.
- Arrays, tuples, Objects, and enums.
- Any, unknown, never, and void.

### 3. **Type Inference and Annotations**
- Letting TypeScript infer types.
- Explicitly annotating types for clarity.

### 4. **Functions**
- Typing function parameters and return values.
- Optional and default parameters.
- Rest parameters.

### 5. **Interfaces and Type Aliases**
- Defining object shapes with `interface`.
- Using `type` for custom types and unions.

### 6. **Classes and Object-Oriented Features**
- Class syntax and modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`).
- Abstract classes and inheritance.

### 7. **Generics**
- Creating reusable functions and components with generics.
- Adding constraints to generics.

### 8. **Type Narrowing**
- Using type guards, `typeof`, `instanceof`, and custom type predicates.
